// There are four parts structured in a Module:
// State: The State section holds all of the raw data (defined as key-value object) related to this particular Module.
// Getters: Getters are functions that take the data in State section, and do some filtering or computation.
// Mutations: Mutations are functions that do one single thing to modify the data in State section.
// Actions: Actions are functions that assemble together multiple Mutations, and call those Mutations in some sequence or series at a very particular time. (Note that itâ€™s fine to call ONLY ONE Mutation in an Action.)

// Purpose of Module:
// working with image resource, like fetching them from Imgur, uploading and deleting images

// Automatic Components Updates:
// anytime we call an ACTION that updates our STATE, it cause every single component that is using one of the module GETTERS to update as well
